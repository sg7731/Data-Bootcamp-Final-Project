# Data-Bootcamp-Final-Project
This contains the final project for the Data Bootcamp class including the full code and data set. 
This final project is about extending the analyses in the paper by Acemoglu et al. called "The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development". We hypothesized that ethnographic factors like ethnicity, language and religion could affect the quality of institutions in a country, which could then affect the GDP per capita. Our project looks at the trends in the data and tries to determine whether this hypothesis is true.
